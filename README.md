<h2>About</h2>
Hope Hospital is a simulation of a real Hospital environment. Using Microsoft SQL Server Studio I recreated some of the different entities you'd see in a real hospital. To be specific, I have tables for Doctors, Patients, Insurance, Billing and Diagnosis with their corresponding foreign key relationships included. The backend is connected to the front end in a seamless fashion.
